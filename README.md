## Welcome to My Github Website!

My names are Jonathan Obise and I love to learn and explore new things. I strongly believe that one of the greatest gift of man is the ability to learn, unlearn and relearn unrestrained!

This website is a work in progress. I hope to update it with all the relevant information as soon as possible.

### Testing 1, 2, 3...

Using markdown to put this all together.

Work in progress...
Coming soon.....
New beginnings are always beautiful and lovely.
